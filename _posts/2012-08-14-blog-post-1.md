This blog aims to guide those people who want to use google cloud to build their deep learning work station on Mac/Windows.

### What you need:
* A Visa card
* PuTTY(Windows) or Terminal(Mac)
* FileZilla or other software which support SFTP

### 1. Registration
First, you need a Google account, and log in to [https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/). Then, click on the free trial to register 
and fill in the basic information. Finally, you need to select the account type (_note_:
the address should be the same as the credit card billing address). 
After the registration, the credit card account will be withheld for 1 USD and will be returned after the registration.


### 2. Project Creation
Before create your own virtual machine, you need to create your project(_note_: Their are one default project whcih were
already created for you) in console place.

### 3. Virtual Machine Creation
After create your project, you can create your own virtual machine now. Click the Navigation menu button at the top left
side, all of the operation related to the virtual machine are on the "Computer Engine" section. If you want to use gpu,
then you need to request gpu quotas in the section 'IAM & admin/Quotas' (i.e. Figure shows below).

Select NVIDIA K80 GPUs and select one of the available services(__note__: you need to remember the location of this service)

In order to save the costs, I only set 50 GB for SSD persistent disk(System) and 256 GB for Standard persistent disk.
